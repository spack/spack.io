[Supercomputing 2020 (SC20)](https://sc20.supercomputing.org/) runs for two weeks beginning on November 9. 
See below for a list of our events.

Be sure to follow

### Mon., November 9

* **10:00am - 2:00pm EST** (live)
  <br/>
  Our tutorial runs over two half-days. [**Managing HPC Software Complexity with Spack: Part 1**](https://sc20.supercomputing.org/presentation/?id=tut132&sess=sess241) 
  kicks off on Monday. Be sure to check out our [tutorial documentation](https://spack-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

  The tutorial provides a thorough introduction to Spackâ€™s capabilities: installing and authoring packages, 
  integrating Spack with development workflows, and using Spack for deployment at HPC facilities. 
  Attendees will leave with foundational skills for using Spack to automate day-to-day tasks, 
  along with deeper knowledge for applying Spack to advanced use cases.

### Tue., November 10

* **10:00am - 2:00pm EST** (live)
  <br/>
  The second day of the tutorial: [**Managing HPC Software Complexity with Spack: Part 2**](https://sc20.supercomputing.org/presentation/?id=pec104&sess=sess267)

### Wed., November 18

* **11:30am - 12:45pm** (live)
  <br/> 
  Join the [**Spack Community BOF**](https://sc20.supercomputing.org/presentation/?id=bof107&sess=sess310)
  and **ask our developers anything**. The core team will give updates on the community, new features, and 
  the roadmap for future development. We will poll the audience to gather valuable information on how Spack 
  is being used, and will open the floor for questions. All are invited to provide feedback, request features, 
  and discuss future directions. Help us make installing HPC software simple!
