The trade journal *R&D World Magazine* announced the winners of its annual awards, sometimes called the “Oscars of invention,” on October 31. And Spack is one of [the winners](https://www.rdworldonline.com/2019-rd-100-award-winners-unveiled/)! The competition recognizes top scientific and engineering products and tech with commercial potential. We also received a silver medal in the Market Disruptor category. Check out [the video](https://youtu.be/D0p5xpsboK4) we submitted for the award and [this photo](https://twitter.com/Livermore_Comp/status/1207092109297123328) of Greg Becker juggling the plaques.
