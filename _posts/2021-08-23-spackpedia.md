The Spack community uses a lot of core terms like *spec* and *package* as well as fun ones like *spackage*. In a new twist on documentation, we've created the Spack Encyclopedia, or [Spackpedia](https://spack.github.io/spackpedia/), to help everyone understand our terminology. Click on a term to see a quick definition with an option to read more. Click "read more" for additional details about the term, an example of its usage, a link to Spack documentation, and related terms.

Spackpedia is a [separate repository](https://github.com/spack/spackpedia) within the [Spack organization](https://github.com/spack) on GitHub, and contributions are welcome. Special thanks to Vanessa Sochat and Alec Scott for getting this off the ground.
