[Supercomputing 2019 (SC19)](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/) kicks off
this week in Denver, and the Spack team will be busy with a
[tutorial](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/presentation/?id=tut164&sess=sess194),
several BOFs, two meet-the-developers sessions at the DOE booth, and even
some papers! See below for a list of events by us and our collaborators.

Be sure to follow
[@spackpm](https://twitter.com/spackpm) on Twitter for updates!

### Sun., November 17

* **1:30pm - 5:00pm**, in 207
  <br/>
  The [**Container Computing for HPC and Scientific Workflows**](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/presentation/?id=tut129&sess=sess206)
  tutorial will have sections on [E4S](https://e4s.io), a software stack
  that uses Spack for deployment, and examples of how to build lightweight
  containers using Spack [environments](https://spack-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_environments.html).
  There is also a BOF on E4S on Tuesday (see below).

### Mon., November 18

* **8:30am - 5:00pm**, in 301
  <br/>
  Join us for our fourth **tutorial** at SC:
  [**Managing HPC Software Complexity with Spack**](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/presentation/?id=tut164&sess=sess194).
  This is an intensive, full-day course on using Spack. This year, we're
  introducing new material on
  [environments](https://spack-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_environments.html),
  [developer workflows](https://spack-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_developer_workflows.html),
  facility deployment with
  [Spack stacks](https://spack-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_stacks.html),
  [scripting](https://spack-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_spack_scripting.html),
  and more.

* **9:30am - 10:00am**, in 605 (NOTE: was Sunday)
  <br/>
  Check out **Sam Knight's paper**,
  [Using Malleable Task Scheduling to Accelerate Package Manager Installations](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/presentation/?id=ws_hust106&sess=sess116)
  at the [HUST'19](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/session/?sess=sess116)
  workshop. This is about ways to pack more Spack builds on a single
  node.

* **11:20am - 11:45am**, in 708
  <br/>
  Sergei Shudler, Nicola Ferrier, Joseph Insley, Michael Papka, and
  Silvio Rizzi from Argonne National Laboratory will be presenting
  [Spack Meets Singularity: Creating Movable In-Situ Analysis Stacks with Ease](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/presentation/?id=ws_isav108&sess=sess126)
  at the [ISAV'19](https://dav.lbl.gov/events/ISAV2019/) workshop. The
  talk covers how to use Spack to ease the process of building
  [Singularity](https://sylabs.io) containers wtih complex visualization
  stacks.

### Tues., November 19

* **12:15pm - 1:15pm**, in 405-406-407
  <br/>
  The first
  [**Extreme-Scale Scientific Software Stack (E4S) BOF**](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/presentation/?id=bof193&sess=sess269)
  will talk about [E4S](https://e4s.io), a community effort to provide
  open source software packages for developing, deploying and running
  scientific applications on high-performance computing (HPC) platforms.
  E4S is part of the U.S.
  [Exascale Computing Project](https://www.exascaleproject.org/), and it
  uses Spack to deploy all of its software.

### Wed., November 20

* **10:00am - 11:00am**, at DOE Booth 925
  <br/>
  **Ask the Spack developers anything** at the first of two roundtables
  at the [DOE Booth](https://scdoe.info/roundtable-discussions/).  Core
  developers will be available to discuss roadmap directions, issues,
  collaborations, or anything else Spack-related.

* **12:15pm - 1:15pm**, in 405-406-407
  <br/>
  Spack will be part of a **panel** on
  best practices at the
  [**Getting Scientific Software Installed BOF**](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/session/?sess=sess299),
  along with Easybuild, Lmod, Singularity, and potentially others. Open
  discussion will be followed with an interactive survey.

### Thurs., November 21

* **12:15pm - 1:15pm**, in 503-504 <br/> The second
  [**Spack Community BOF**](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/session/?sess=sess310)
  at SC, will feature a brief presentation by core developers on the
  latest Spack release and roadmap directions, followed by an interactive
  survey.

* **2:30pm - 3:30pm**, at DOE Booth 925
  <br/>
  **Ask the Spack
  developers anything** at the
  [DOE Booth](https://scdoe.info/roundtable-discussions/).  Once again,
  core developers will be available to discuss roadmap directions,
  issues, collaborations, or anything else Spack-related.

### Fri., November 22

* **9:45am - 10:00am**, in 405-406-407
  <br/>
  Carson Woods, Matt Curry, and Anthony Skjellum will be **presenting**
  [**Implementing a Common HPC Environment in a Multi-User Spack Instance**](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/presentation/?id=ws_hpcsysp106&sess=sess129)
  at the
  [HPC System Professionals Workshop](http://sighpc-syspros.org/workshops/2019/).
