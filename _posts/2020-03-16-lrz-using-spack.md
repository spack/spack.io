At the start of the new decade, it is the right time to reflect on the
use of Spack at the
[Leibniz Supercomputing Centre (LRZ)](https://www.lrz.de). We’d like to
take a look at the current developments and pull out the crystal ball for
a glimpse into the (near) future.

The story of LRZ using Spack goes back to early 2018. With the then
forthcoming procurement of
[SuperMUC-NG](https://doku.lrz.de/display/PUBLIC/SuperMUC-NG), currently
Germany’s fastest supercomputer, a small team of HPC software application
support staff set out to optimize software installations on the LRZ
clusters. On the predecessor systems, each software package had been
installed and managed individually. Over the years, this software stack
had grown enormously and become so large, that a continuation of this
practice was no longer feasible. Spack promised both: a consistent and
flexible framework for installing and maintaining software. And Spack
delivered, so porting the LRZ stack to Spack began.

In the second half of 2018, a beta release of this software stack was put
into operation on the Linux Cluster, a heterogeneous cluster system
serving the [Munich](https://www.uni-muenchen.de/index.html)
[universities](https://www.tum.de/) and researchers all over Bavaria. At
the same time, the deployment phase for SuperMUC-NG continued and when
early user operations began, the primary software stack was Spack-based,
providing more than 220 software modules to users. Since then, another
internal release at the end of 2019 delivered updated libraries and
applications to users.

Now, as the
[predecessor system](https://www.lrz.de/wir/newsletter/2019-12_en/#Adieu_SuperMUC_Phase1)
has reached its end of life and was switched off at the turn of the year,
the software installations on all high performance cluster systems
currently operated at LRZ are managed by Spack.

While continuously integrating more packages into Spack (notable pending
exceptions are some core components like certain compilers and MPI
libraries), the new year’s resolution of the team is to move to the
latest upstream version of Spack. This will introduce anticipated new
features like chaining with the expressed goal of having users configure
and install their own software, individually, while building upon the
common software stack provided by LRZ. Also, with further refined
environments and stacks as well as microarchitecture-targeting, it will
be possible to replace substantial internal configuration and code
customizations.

The team is looking forward to continuing to work alongside the very active
Spack community, contributing to upstream development and user support
while putting the fun back in supercomputer software installation and
maintenance with Spack!
