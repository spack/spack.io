Until now, spack.io has mostly been a landing page -- an easy-to-remember
URL with a brief description of Spack and links out to other, more
important project pages.  The old spack.io was great as a splash page,
but its single-page layout was a bit cramped for all the stuff going on
in the world of Spack.  We're developing new features and new
collaborations rapidly, and we'd like to be able to highlight important
news with blog articles and links.

Today, spack.io has a new look. We're using the
[Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme
to give ourselves a bit more room.  The new layout has multiple pages,
and we're adding a [blog](/blog/), an [event list](/events/), and a
[links](/links/) page.  We'll be populating these with articles ond
interesting links.  also, you can still find the highlights from the old
page under [About](/about/).

<img align="right" src="/assets/images/new-spack.io.png" width="150"> For
our first feature, we've compiled a list of
[**events at SC19**](http://127.0.0.1:4000/spack-at-sc19/).  There are
tutorials, BOFs, meetups with the Spack developers, and more.  Check it
out, and hope to see you at the conference!
