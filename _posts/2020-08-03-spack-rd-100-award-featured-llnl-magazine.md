The July issue of Lawrence Livermore's magazine *Science & Technology Review* features Spack as one of the Lab's four winning technologies from 2019. The article titled ["Software Installation Simplified"](https://str.llnl.gov/2020-07/gamblin) covers Spack's origins, mechanisms, key features, and thriving open source community.
