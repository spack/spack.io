HPC centers are always prepping for the next big thing. LLNL's El Capitan supercomputer, coming online in 2023, will help usher in the exascale era with its peak expected performance of 2 exaflops. In this [HPCwire article](https://www.hpcwire.com/2020/03/04/exascale-watch-el-capitan-will-use-amd-cpus-gpus-to-reach-2-exaflops/), LLNL's CTO Bronis de Supinski describes readying software deployment for El Capitan -- a process that will include Spack as the machine's deployment tool.
