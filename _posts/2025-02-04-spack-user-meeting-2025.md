We hope you can join us for the first ever Spack User Meeting (SUM) in Chicago, IL on
May 7th and 8th, 2025, as part of the first
[High Performance Software Foundation (HPSFcon) conference](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/hpsf-conference/).

## What to Expect
* **Updates from Spack developers** We'll give a talk on the State of the Spack
  ecosystem, and we'll have technical updates on the latest features and release
  road map.
* **User presentations** We hope to feature many presentations from Spack users on their
  experiences and on what they've built with Spack.
* **Poster Session** There will also be a poster session at where you can showcase your
  work and interact with others.
* **Networking Opportunities** SUM is hosted in conjunction with HPSFCon, so you can
  meet folks from other HPC communities -- including other
  [HPSF projects](http://hpsf.io/projects/).

## Who Should Attend:

Anyone in the Spack community: users, developers, dev-ops, system administrators, user
support staff, or anyone interested in learning more.

# Why Attend SUM / HPSFcon:

We think it's time we gave our users a forum to present what they're building with
Spack. This the first ever in-person Spack user meeting, and we're hoping to learn about
all the things you're building. So far, the Spack community has gotten together at BOF
sessions at conferences, exchanged comments on GitHub, and has been very active on
Slack. The inaugural SUM meeting will give us an even higher bandwidth, interactive
venue to exchange ideas and to get a better sense of the needs of the community.

SUM is also part of HPSFcon, which is the first-ever conference of the High Performance
Software Foundation, bringing together the community of developers and users of
open-source software for high-performance computing. This is a unique opportunity to
learn about the latest trends and technologies in HPC and connect with leaders in the
field.

## Call for Submissions:

We are seeking presentations and lightning talks for SUM.

20-minute presentations: Share your experiences using Spack - any and all spack-related
topics are welcome!

* User experience reports with Spack
* Best practices for using Spack in different environments
* Tools, applications, and other software you've built on top of Spack
* Best practices and deployment stories
* Unique use cases for Spack
* War stories and other problems you've encountered
* Suggestions for features and improvements
* Integration of Spack into DevOps pipelines, applications, and unique environments
* and, yes, all your pain points -- we want to know how we can improve Spack!
