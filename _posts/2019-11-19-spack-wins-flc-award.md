We're excited to announce that Spack received a [regional technology transfer award](https://www.llnl.gov/news/lawrence-livermore-wins-three-regional-flc-awards) from the Federal Laboratory Consortium (FLC). The FLC has been around since 1974 and recognizes federal labs and their industry partners for outstanding tech transfer achievements. Thanks to the global Spack community for helping us make Spack what it is!
