## 2020

### [ISC High Performance](https://www.isc-hpc.com/)
<small class="pull-right">22-24 June, 2020 | Frankfurt, Germany (DEFERRED)</small>  
ISC (formerly known as the International Supercomputing Conference), the biggest Supercomputing event in Europe, is typically held in Frankfurt in June. This year’s conference has been replaced with a virtual event from June 22-24, but the virtual program will unfortunately not include BoFs (birds of a feather) or Tutorials. The [Spack community BoF](https://www.isc-hpc.com/bof-sessions-2020.html) and [half-day tutorial](https://www.isc-hpc.com/tutorials-2020.html) will instead be held as part of the 2021 program.

### [ASC S3C](https://s3c.sandia.gov/)
<small class="pull-right">14-16 April 2020 | Albuquerque, NM (POSTPONED)</small>  
The Tri-lab Advanced Simulation & Computing Sustainable Scientific Software Conference connects individuals and teams from the ASC Tri-labs that are working to deliver scientific software solutions in a sustainable manner. Greg Becker will present a 20-minute talk and lead a half-day tutorial on Spack.
