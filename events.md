### [ISC High Performance](https://www.isc-hpc.com/)
<small class="pull-right">22-24 June 2020 | Frankfurt, Germany (DEFERRED)</small>

This year’s conference has been replaced with a virtual event from June 22-24, but the virtual program will unfortunately not include BoFs (birds of a feather) or tutorials. The [Spack community BoF](https://www.isc-hpc.com/bof-sessions-2020.html) and [half-day tutorial](https://www.isc-hpc.com/tutorials-2020.html) will instead be held as part of the 2021 program.
