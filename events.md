### [Spack Tutorial on AWS](https://spacktutorialonaws.splashthat.com/)
<small class="pull-right">28-29 July 2020 | Online</small>  
Amazon Web Services is hosting a two-day Spack tutorial broadly targeted at HPC users, developers, and user support teams. Each day consists of two 1.5-hour sessions with a 30-minute break in the middle (4-7:30pm CET / 7-10:30pm PT). The first day will cover Spack basics, while the second day will dive deeper on advanced features. Registration is free at the link above.


### [HPC Best Practices Webinar Series](https://www.exascaleproject.org/event/what-is-new-in-spack/)
<small class="pull-right">15 July 2020 | Online</small>  
The IDEAS Productivity project, in partnership with the DOE Computing Facilities of the ALCF, OLCF, and NERSC and the DOE Exascale Computing Project, hosts a webinar series on Best Practices for HPC Software Developers. A webinar titled "What’s New in Spack?" will be presented by Todd Gamblin on Wednesday, July 15 at 1:00-2:00 pm ET. [Slides](https://www.exascaleproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ideas-whats-new-in-spack.pdf) and a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDRx51PyHYw) (1:26:33) from the session are available.


### [ISC High Performance](https://www.isc-hpc.com/)
<small class="pull-right">22-24 June 2020 | Frankfurt, Germany (DEFERRED)</small>  
ISC (formerly known as the International Supercomputing Conference), the biggest Supercomputing event in Europe, is typically held in Frankfurt in June. This year’s conference has been replaced with a virtual event from June 22-24, but the virtual program will unfortunately not include BoFs (birds of a feather) or tutorials. The [Spack community BoF](https://www.isc-hpc.com/bof-sessions-2020.html) and [half-day tutorial](https://www.isc-hpc.com/tutorials-2020.html) will instead be held as part of the 2021 program.

### [CERN Grid Deployment Board Meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/event/813800/)
<small class="pull-right">5 May 2020 | Geneva, Switzerland (REMOTE)</small>  
CERN operates the world's largest particle physics laboratory and is home to the Large Hadron Collider. As part of the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid Collaboration (WLCG), CERN's Grid Deployment Board will meet to talk about container distribution and modern packaging approaches -- like Spack. Notable presentations for the Spack community include:
