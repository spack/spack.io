## 2020

### [ISC High Performance](https://www.isc-hpc.com/)
<small class="pull-right">22-24 June 2020 | Frankfurt, Germany (DEFERRED)</small>  
ISC (formerly known as the International Supercomputing Conference), the biggest Supercomputing event in Europe, is typically held in Frankfurt in June. This year’s conference has been replaced with a virtual event from June 22-24, but the virtual program will unfortunately not include BoFs (birds of a feather) or Tutorials. The [Spack community BoF](https://www.isc-hpc.com/bof-sessions-2020.html) and [half-day tutorial](https://www.isc-hpc.com/tutorials-2020.html) will instead be held as part of the 2021 program.

CERN operates the world's largest particle physics laboratory and is home to the Large Hadron Collider. As part of the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid Collaboration (WLCG), CERN's Grid Deployment Board will meet to discuss container distribution and modern packaging approaches. Notable presentations for the Spack community include:
