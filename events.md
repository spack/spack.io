## 2020

### [ISC High Performance](https://www.isc-hpc.com/)
<small class="pull-right">22-24 June 2020 | Frankfurt, Germany (DEFERRED)</small>  
ISC (formerly known as the International Supercomputing Conference), the biggest Supercomputing event in Europe, is typically held in Frankfurt in June. This year’s conference has been replaced with a virtual event from June 22-24, but the virtual program will unfortunately not include BoFs (birds of a feather) or Tutorials. The [Spack community BoF](https://www.isc-hpc.com/bof-sessions-2020.html) and [half-day tutorial](https://www.isc-hpc.com/tutorials-2020.html) will instead be held as part of the 2021 program.

### Springtime Spack Features in the Media

* [RSE Stories podcast](http://us-rse.org/rse-stories/posts/): from the U.S. Research Software Engineer Association

### [CERN Grid Deployment Board Meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/event/813800/)
<small class="pull-right">5 May 2020 | Geneva, Switzerland (REMOTE)</small>  
CERN operates the world's largest particle physics laboratory and is home to the Large Hadron Collider. As part of the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid Collaboration (WLCG), CERN's Grid Deployment Board will meet to discuss container distribution and modern packaging approaches. Notable presentations for the Spack community include:

* Nikola Hardi, CERN: [ALICE Software Deployment](https://indico.cern.ch/event/813800/contributions/3843633/attachments/2032041/3401141/alice_nhardi_hsf_wlcg_pregdb_2020.pdf)

The Tri-lab Advanced Simulation & Computing Sustainable Scientific Software Conference connects individuals and teams from the ASC Tri-labs that are working to deliver scientific software solutions in a sustainable manner. Greg Becker will present a 20-minute talk and lead a half-day tutorial on Spack.
